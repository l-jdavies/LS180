Hmm... it turns out that 25 characters isn't enough room to store a star's complete name. For instance, the star "Epsilon Trianguli Australis A" requires 30 characters. Modify the column so that it allows star names as long as 50 characters.

```
ALTER TABLE stars ALTER COLUMN name TYPE varchar(50);
```
