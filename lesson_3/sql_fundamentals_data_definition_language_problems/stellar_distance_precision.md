For many of the closest stars, we know the distance from Earth fairly accurately; for instance, Proxima Centauri is roughly 4.3 light years away. Our database, as currently defined, only allows integer distances, so the most accurate value we can enter is 4. Modify the distance column in the stars table so that it allows fractional light years to any degree of precision required.

```
ALTER TABLE stars 
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE numeric;
```
